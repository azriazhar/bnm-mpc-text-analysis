The Malaysian economy entered 2004 on a more positive note with growth expected to strengthen further during the year. Economic and financial indicators have confirmed earlier expectations that the global economic recovery is gaining momentum. Strengthening external demand has translated into a more rapid growth in Malaysian exports. The strong recovery in export growth, sustained growth in consumer spending and private investment activity raised the real GDP growth to 6.4% in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly growth since the fourth quarter of 2000.The stronger economic performance is taking place in an environment of low inflation. Sectors experiencing strong growth are expanding capacity, while increasing competition in both the product and labour markets and low inflation abroad will reduce price pressures. In this period, accommodative monetary policy would therefore continue to support growth. The low interest rate environment will remain to reinforce the private sector-led expansion.
